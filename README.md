# Final Project for 15-394 Rapid Prototyping Technologies
This is a laser engraved LED lamp with a Pokemon theme! This was originally inspired by the confused pikachu meme, and I wanted to make a rendition
of the meme based on our Rapid Prototyping class. There is an LED lamp that was created out of an LED strip and programmed on an Arudino UNO and a base
created from 3D printed Pokeballs and laser cutted parts. The plastic parts can be replaced, and I included two designs that are Pokemon theme.

The pikachu design is inspired by the meme. When creating this design, I wanted to focus on making Pikachu 3D in a 2D fields, thus the contours.
The other design is an image adapted by the web (https://www.usgamer.net/articles/30-05-2018-pokemon-switch-stars-release-date-everything-we-know)
but created into a DXF file by an online converter. After the file was converted, I edited it in Inkscape so that all the background "noise" were eliminated and additional lines were connected. While making the latch and side walls for the base, I used reference geometry within individual files to determine what size would be most suitable for the end of this project, which originally depended on an aluminum part as the base. Interestingly, the latch was modeled after the Uber logo. It keeps the plastic design from moving around too much in the plastic base.

The walls were also engraved with the Pokemon logo and assembled in a manner similar to the pascaline box. The engravings
do light up, as seen in the videos here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sjaMHiJyzPuXbkin16mbOLq8b7SuU13d, and can be used as a night lamp or as a cool decoration to a Pokemon-themed party.

The lamp also has capabilities to change the design, so the user does not have to stick to Pokemon themed designs. For example, I also included
another design that I wanted to incorporate using this lamp based on the Randy Pausch bridge.

NOTE: For the Arduino, if the wires become loose, plug the white wire into port 6, green wire into the 5V port, and blue wire into ground. Plug the USB to a wire source and watch the lights glow.
